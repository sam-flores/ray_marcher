# ray_marcher

This program renders a scene using the ray tracer algorithm. To run,

- clone the repository
- compile the code using "cc main.c -lm -lX11"
- run the code using "./a.out"

You should see a screen pop up. You should see two toruses rotating and intersecting with a sphere to demonstrate the ray marcher's ability to render basic primitives as well as account for rotation, scaling, translation, and color.
